# Http-based-object-download-using-socket-programming
The project downloads objects from websites by creating a TCP connection, the links of objects are provided by an input text file. 
There are two versions of the project:

1. Persistent :- In this case all the objects are downloaded over a single TCP connection, this approach takes less time.

2. Non-persistent:- A new connection is created each time to download a paricular object
